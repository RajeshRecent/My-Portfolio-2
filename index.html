            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                At PlanWell Finance, we believe in purposeful, transparent financial advice. The market is full of options, yet many investors feel uncertain or overwhelmed—often buying products without understanding their real benefits, maturity values, or redemption terms. Our approach is different: we guide you to truly know what you’re investing in, evaluate the actual growth and safety of each option, and avoid the common traps of over-marketed SIPs, mutual funds, or impulsive spending on social trends. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We educate you on every aspect: health plans, retirement strategies, stable profit investments, coverage for medical and life events, and more. Whether you’re planning for mental well-being, a secure retirement, or effective wealth creation, our goal is to build your peace of mind through solid, smart financial planning. Don’t just follow the crowd—choose your financial path with understanding and confidence.
            </p>
